#v0-7 **Made a separate screen for scanning**
Shows a message while waiting for the operation to complete.

~~This screen is shown only while the application scans for files. It shows which path it currently scans. It shows how many subfolders and files were found. It also blocks all clicks so there is no way to misclick anything.~~
