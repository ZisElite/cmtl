# Custom musig tag library - cmtl

## Disclaimer

The app does not edit the music file's tag data. It functions more like a general music library app, with the ability to add tags (labels) to a file and filter through them. Uses SQLite database to keep track of everything.

## Description
Custom Music Tag Library (cmtl) helps in creation of custom tag libraies for music files. Users can create libraries (databases) and add music files to them by providing the path to a single file or a whole directory. 
Directories and their subdirectories ar escanned and all music files are added to the library. After that, custom tags can be created and assigned to the library files. Each file can have any number of tags. The tags and file locations 
can be used as filters.

## How it started
I have a big library of music and sound effects, for use in games and my blender videos. Unfortunately, with thousands of files to choose from and with each file possibly being suitable for many different situations, 
it was difficult to find the one I wanted. I decided to create my own custom tagging application in Godot, effectively killing two birds with one stone. I now have an app and knowledge on how to use UI containers to create UIs.

## Usage
Just extract the files and run the "v0.1.exe", after that:
1. Create a new library
2. Add at least one file/path
3. Add at least one tag
4. Select the files and the tag you want to assign
You are now ready to start tagging your files.

(I am planning on adding an in-app help section with more detailed instructions)
