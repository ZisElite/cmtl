# Custom musig tag library - cmtl
Custom Music Tag Library (cmtl) is a simple program that helps in creation of custom tag libraies for music files

## Disclaimer

The app does not edit the music file's tag data. It functions more like a general music library app, with the ability to add tags (labels) to a file and filter through them. Uses SQLite database to keep track of everything.
